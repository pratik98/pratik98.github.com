I made my first website during 3rd year of my diploma engineering. it was plain **XHTML + CSS** website. since then i have enjoyed working on server-side web apps using **PHP, Ajax**; couple of mobile apps for **Android** and few mobile sites using **Jquery Mobile**. 

I have been fortunate to be a part of technical team of my college's annual techfest [FootPrints.](http://www.msu-footprints.org) I have worked on Event Registration system, Android app and mobile website for FootPrints.

I have also worked on [ Training and Placement portal](http://ftemsu-placements.org/) of my college.
 
Here are some more details about the projects that I have worked on -

# [NextBus - An SMS Based Application ] #
This SMS application allows user to send SMS to pre specified cell number with "origin/destination" query from cell phone and user would receive SMS containing bus timings of next available bus.
This is my 7th semester .NET project. The goal was to access internet from the low end device such as Nokia 1100. I developed SMS Gateway using Android and  Web Service using ASP.NET/C#. 

The Android SMS Gateway Receives SMS and Sends SOAP request to Web Service. Web Service replies with SOAP Response. Android APP then extracts details from SOAP Response and send to user via SMS.
