**What's the point of this post? No point, honestly. Just documenting my frustration.**

* (January 2023) My university department informed me that I could continue working full-time after completing my master's degree. All I needed was a master's completion certificate to receive a contract from the university administration.

* I waited for my professors to enter my master's thesis grade, as I couldn't obtain the master's completion certificate without it. Sending an email to the examination office proved unhelpful.

* My professors eventually entered my grade in the online portal, allowing me to receive the certificate.

* I submitted this certificate to the university administration.

* The university administration responded, stating that I couldn't receive a contract because I didn't have a valid working visa.

* I emailed the foreign office to request a work visa appointment, but received no response.

* I visited the foreign office in person and, after waiting in line for two hours, secured a visa appointment scheduled for two weeks later.

* On the day of my appointment, the visa officer informed me that I couldn't obtain a visa yet because they needed to request my employment contract from the Agentur f√ºr Arbeit (employment agency). This process would take an additional two weeks.

* After waiting for two weeks, I received a document from the foreign office stating that I could start working.

* I submitted this document to the university administration.

* (April 2023) As of today, I am still awaiting a response from the university administration regarding whether I can begin working or not.
