* Become a person that initiates. Others will follow.

* Software development isn't abt knowing everything. It's abt knowing what u don't know & 
learning what u need to learn to solve the problem.

* I do not like the fact that they(youth) often form REALLY strong opinions on every little thing, and 
mostly have zero data or logic to back it up.

* First do it, then do it right, then do it better.

* Learn to move on. Learn to let go. Learn to be considerate. People make mistakes, you make 
mistakes. Give everyone a generous margin for error in life. Forgive and forget. Control what 
you can and don't lose sight of your own dreams.

* The purpose of education is to provide you the toolsets that enables you take the data 
around you, make sense out of it and find out a way to create something productive out of 
that.
