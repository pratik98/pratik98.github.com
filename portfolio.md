## Sankey Diagrams for Electricity-Mix ##
I developed framework for generating sankey plots and time-series animation.
These plots became a part of [Deutschland auf dem Weg zur Klimaneutralität 2045 – Szenarien und Pfade im Modellvergleich Report.](https://ariadneprojekt.de/publikation/deutschland-auf-dem-weg-zur-klimaneutralitat-2045-szenarienreport/)

## Barchart Racing Animation  ##
This is an ongoing visualization side project of mine where i collect, clean and visualize different datasets using barchart racing animation. Currently, exploring various datasets from India and Germany.
All Visualizations are available on [YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkGTRv6_dWh5tcKiznSyv1Hcaf69RFCgA)


### Few Visualizations: ###

* Indian Loksabha Election Results from 1951 to 2014
* Net Positive Migration to Germany from European Countries (1991-2020)
* Refugee Migration to Germany (2010-2020)
* Per Capita Net State Domestic Product in India (2004-2019)

## Data About India - Geo-Spatial Maps ##
This Side project is my effort to answer some very basic questions about India using data visualizations and statistics. I constantly look for datasets and data sources related to India on web and try to come up with some insights and easy to understand visualizations. 

All Visualizations are available on my [Data About India Blog.](https://dataaboutindia.wordpress.com/)

## WallStreetBets Beyond GameStop, YOLOs, and the Moon: The Unique Traits of Reddit’s Finance Communities ##


### Abstract: ###
While the effect of established social media on stock markets has been thoroughly investigated, the recent surge in retail investing and the emergence of different finance-related Reddit communities with unique new traits have led to new research questions. In this work, we aim to understand the linguistic and thematic characteristics and differences of the largest financial Reddit communities, r/WallStreetBets, r/stocks, and r/investing. Using different techniques for the analysis of linguistic features and topic modeling, we identify keywords and phrases that are most prominent in each community and determine each community’s thematic focus and risk affinity. An analysis of users that post on all of these communities confirm these findings, as they appear to adapt to the respective target audience when posting. The stock returns for each community prove consistent with their respective risk profile. Overall, we conclude that understanding these communities can help investors in making more informed investment decisions.
