# Data Analystics and Visualization Projects # 


## Sankey Diagrams for Electricity-Mix ##
I developed framework for generating sankey plots and time-series animation.
These plots became a part of [Deutschland auf dem Weg zur Klimaneutralität 2045 – Szenarien und Pfade im Modellvergleich Report.](https://ariadneprojekt.de/publikation/deutschland-auf-dem-weg-zur-klimaneutralitat-2045-szenarienreport/)

## Bar-chart Racing Animation  ##
This is an ongoing visualization side project of mine where i collect, clean and visualize different datasets using barchart racing animation. Currently, exploring various datasets from India and Germany.
All Visualizations are available on [YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkGTRv6_dWh5tcKiznSyv1Hcaf69RFCgA)


### Few Visualizations: ###

* Indian Loksabha Election Results from 1951 to 2014
* Net Positive Migration to Germany from European Countries (1991-2020)
* Refugee Migration to Germany (2010-2020)
* Per Capita Net State Domestic Product in India (2004-2019)

## Data About India - Geo-Spatial Maps ##
This Side project is my effort to answer some very basic questions about India using data visualizations and statistics. I constantly look for datasets and data sources related to India on web and try to come up with some insights and easy to understand visualizations. 

All Visualizations are available on my [Data About India Blog.](https://dataaboutindia.wordpress.com/)

# Machine Learning Projects # 

## Forest Fire Prediction ##
This project was a part of Machine Learning course during my MSc. 
Predict wildfires based on weather data of the Fire-Weather-Index (FWI).

### Dataset: ###
 Forest fire data from Montesinho natural park located in the Tras-os-Montes northeastregion of Portugal from January 2000 to December 2003. [[Paper]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238767143_A_Data_Mining_Approach_to_Predict_Forest_Fires_using_Meteorological_Data)

### Code: [GitHub](https://github.com/pratik98/Machine-LearningSummer2020/tree/master/Forest%20Fire%20Prediction%20Project) ###
